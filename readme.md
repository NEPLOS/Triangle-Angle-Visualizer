# Triangle Angle Thingy

## Why I Made This?

Honestly... I donâ€™t really remember.  
Pretty sure I just made it for fun near the end of my first semester,
when I was finally getting comfy with c++ and raylib

You drag three little circles (red, yellow, blue)
and it draws a triangle between them and shows you the angles
That's pretty much it

Not super useful, but it looks kinda cool
